    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>On March 1, 2022, we said goodbye to our beloved Jamil. In his passing, we lost a vibrant soul who was full of joie de vivre.</p>
    <p>Jamil had an admirable work ethic, often times effortlessly clocking in twelve hour days. His sense of responsibility to his clients (both as an accountant in Italy and later as an immigration consultant in Canada) was exceptional.</p>
    <p>Despite this, he was known by all of his friends for his good humour. He never passed an opportunity to crack a joke and perpetually exuded positive energy and optimism.</p>
    <p>Music was a big part of Jamil's life. He started playing the guitar in his teens and continued to play the guitar for decades thereafter. Though he got his start in classic rock, he grew to enjoy a variety of music genres.</p>
    <p>We would be remiss if we did not mention Jamil's love for the finer things in life! He adored good food--especially Italian cuisine. Indeed, those fortunate enough to have tasted Jamil's pasta can attest to his adoration of it. In addition to good food, he enjoyed fine clothes and always dressed to impress.</p>
    <p>Lastly, it goes without saying that Jamil had an immense capacity for love. It often seemed that he loved his wife, son, family, and friends twice as intensely as the rest of us are able to love.</p>
    <p>This is a space to celebrate his <a href="#life">life</a> and remember him fondly through <a href="#gallery">pictures and video</a> and <a href="#stories">stories</a>. We invite you to contribute your own pictures, videos, and stories so those who love Jamil may use this space to reminisce.</p>
    <p>We love and miss you, Jamil. We will never forget you. May you rest in peace.</p>
